An ASP.NET Blazor application that lets me access sensor readings that I have running on a Raspberry pi in my room
This project lets me monitor sensor readings in my room that runs on a Raspberry Pi with a DHT22 sensor 24/7

A MySQL database hosted on Azure opens the opportunity for the Blazor application to receive the sensor readings from my Raspberry Pi

The project is deployed on Azure at https://kristofferhusdata.azurewebsites.net/
